## What is a RESTful API

 Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface is a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs allow different software systems to communicate over the internet using standard protocols, most commonly HTTP. These APIs are essential in modern software development due to their simplicity, scalability, and flexibility. The primary purpose of a RESTful API is to enable communication between clients (like web or mobile applications) and servers in a standardized way. RESTful APIs allow clients to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources on a server. These operations correspond to the HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.


## **NWUTechTrends RESTful API**

The API designed for the NWUTechTrends project 2 is a RESTful service that supports the management of clients, processes, projects, and job telemetries. This API enables NWU Tech Trends to track time and cost savings from automation processes across different clients and projects. The API is crucial for facilitating efficient data management, reporting, and client interaction within the system.
